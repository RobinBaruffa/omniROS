# deep-rl
Collection of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Dependencies: 

* [Tensorflow 1.3.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
* [tflearn](http://tflearn.org/installation/)
* [OpenAI Gym 0.9.2](https://github.com/openai/gym/)

Tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6

So far: 

1. DDPG - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients, evaluated on the Pendulum-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym.

## Applications

If you have used this code to do something cool, send me a link and a GIF (via email or pull request) and I'll add it

1. @keithmgould [used the same the DDPG code](https://github.com/keithmgould/deep-rl) to solve the inverted Pendulum task in Roboschool. ![InvertedPendulum demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithmgould/deep-rl/master/demo.gif)
